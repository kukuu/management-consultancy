# Digital Transformation 

Mission: Drive digital capability and optimise operational efficiency


Digital Transformation is the change associated with the application of digital technology. However, digital transformation is more than technology. It is a mindset shift. It is the adoption of new ways of working and ultimately it is the marrying of people and process to gain a competitive advantage.

When planning for digital transformation, organizations must factor the cultural changes they'll confront as workers and organizational leaders adjust to adopting and relying on unfamiliar technologies.

Practices used in transformation include methodologies like Agile (SCRUM, KANBAN) , XP, Waterfall, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, Micro-services, Containerization, Severless Computing, IaaS, PaaS, ITaaS, Headerless CMS, Hybrid CMS, Big Data, Analytics, Machine Learning, Change Management, Cloud Computing, Digital Security, Leadership & Development,IoT,Chat Bots, Video Chats, and Mobility Management.

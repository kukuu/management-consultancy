# Case Study: Technical Consulting and Stakeholder Management
 

 
## Technical Consulting
  

Daisy Sharks, an up-and-coming retailer, wants to create a superior, seamless app experience to increase their mobile conversion rate. Although they have a presence on Amazon, they want a tool that can also reinforce their brick and mortar and online presence - activating their brand in a new, fulfilling way.

### Industry Conditions:

Retail is a hot innovation space. Every retailer feels the pressure of not only Amazon, but also big box stores offering their own in-house brands, often at a very competitive price. Now isn’t the time to be conservative. If a retailer doesn’t take steps to become a home screen mainstay, their potential customers will choose convenience.

### Tactical Considerations: 

As with most retail brands, Shazzle relies on special promotions and others to optimize their sales. These programs are dominantly email or banner driven, but they want a higher level of instant, relevant communication, as well as customization. With a strong website driving decent traffic and interaction, they are in a prime position to kick-off  a PWA initiative.

#### PWA (Progressive Web App) Partnership: Shared Expertise and Honest Communication.

Daisy Sharks has chosen to partner with Testenium, an innovative company familiar with designing and building a variety of app experiences, including PWAs. As the project officially kicks off, there are critical considerations discussed upfront to ensure alignment and efficiency.

1. Confirm a PWA is best solution to achieve the defined goals.

The ideal partner provide objective, dispassionate input and evaluations. Chances are Daisy Sharks (or most other companies) don’t come to the table saying, “We want a progressive web app.” The innovation partner must be prepared to guide a business through the process of app type determination. If the main benefits of PWAs align with business goals, the foundation for success is already in place.

2. Establish a development approach.

The design and development teams need to identify the technical specifics of how the current Daisy Sharks browser experience operates and relates to the range of their desired browser needs. The outcome of this investigation will help decide what direction the build will take: graceful degradation or progressive enhancement.

i. Two Approaches to Browser Diversity

The problem with designing websites is that various offices and individual consumers access the internet through a wide variety of portals. Not only are different browsers and operating systems being used, but some devices are outdated and running a long-defunct version of their operating system. Any “fancy things” (such as a CSS animation) that the developer comes up with won’t be able to run on systems that don’t have the capacity for sophisticated operations. Both partners must be aware and committed to one of these approaches:

a. Graceful degradation: 

This means designing web functionality at a high level of browser capability and then building in an ability for this to “degrade gracefully.” People with older, slower browsers will have a less sophisticated experience, but the basic functions will still work. It’s a somewhat retroactive, but potentially valuable, method.

b. Progressive enhancement:

This approach  flips the priorities. The designer creates a clean, basic experience for every web visitor. Then they add advanced functionality that will automatically be available to any browser able to use it. This approach allows for ongoing revisions as new technical abilities become available. It’s considered a forward-looking, future proof or “progressive” approach.

3. Communicate realistic design/build expectations (for both partners).

Working closely together and defining design expectations helps prevent either partner from jumping to conclusions about outcomes. To save the time, money, and frustration, Testenium builds time into their project discovery plan to discuss Daisy Sharks' thoughts around:

i. Offline features: It’s a catchy concept to think of having a site that still works well offine, but it’s important to be clear on which parts of the website will work offine.

ii. Responsive design: Reaching the customer on whatever device they happen to be using with intuitive, well-branded design and content is crucial. Responsive design allows for this consistency. Image and  file sizes must be compatible.

iii. Touch screen vs trackpad interaction concepts:
Understanding the offerings and emphasis around these functionalities is best established upfront to avoid excess iteration.

iv. Hardware access conditions: It is important to identify access authority for a range of users.

v. Marketing approach: PWAs must be marketed more like websites than apps, which the user has to go to a store and procure. This convenience is a huge selling point.

4. Define the user journey.

Once Daisy Sharks is comfortable with their user personas and possibilities, they need to think about what features and content will best drive their goal of increased mobile conversion. Answering the following questions will inform their PWA strategy:

i. What do they want their users to do and see - and when? Page load, before scroll etc

ii. What information and visual hierarchy helps ensure conversion?

iii. What is the best CTA (Call to Action - courtesy of the BBC) approach based on past user data?

iv. How can website traffic trends inform the functionality of the PWA?

v. The more vision into current customer metrics and/or research  findings Daisy Sharks can offer the team, the higher the launch pad becomes. Additionally, if they’re looking to maintain communication throughout the user lifecycle, a strategy involving push notifications makes good sense.

5. Optimize the testing/QA plan.

Defining a testing plan for PWAs needs solid planning far in advance of the actual QA process. PWAs offer  flexibility, which is great. But, in the absence of a testing plan, this  fexibility can be detrimental to the testing process. 

Your development budget drains quickly if you and your developer get too deep in trying to run tests on the seemingly infinite use cases. Daisy Sharks takes a best practices tip and collaborates with the team to build a test plan that focuses on important highlights, while waiting and watching the other functions.


###  Common PWA Build Challenges

This is Daisy Sharks' first PWA build, so they won’t be able to anticipate potential obstacles. Fortunately the team at Testenium offers transparency with regard to learnings from past experiences. Armed with this information, Daisy Sharks can take steps to mitigate any stumbling blocks with planning and communication.

i. The biggest PWA stumbling block is an outdated code base.

Small technical issues within a website can be enough to derail development. PWAs cannot be built on top of broken or archaic code - nor can they  fix it. Even if the website is mostly functional, outdated conventions and bulky work-arounds can cause problems for the PWA. 

The barrier for entry for ordinary websites is low. Many business owners have no idea their website is shaky until they want to make an enhancement.

ii. Abuse of push notifications damage user relationships.

Push notifications offer value in building a merchant’s relationship with customers, but many companies get a little trigger-happy. It’s important to be strategic - just like with email campaigns and other outbound communications. 

If users are hit over the head with reminders and notifications, they will silence them. Brand preference and loyalty will suffer.

## Stakeholder Management

Stakeholder engagement and stakeholder management are arguably the most important ingredients for successful project delivery, and yet are often regarded as a fringe activity or one that can be outsourced to business-as-usual functions. Project managers depend on people to respond to the outputs and benefits that they deliver.

People will only respond if they are engaged. The phrase “stakeholder management" implies that these people can be made to respond positively to a project, but the truth is that a project manager frequently has no formal power of authority and therefore has to rely on engagement to achieve his/her objectives.

### Communicate

Before aiming to engage and influence stakeholders, it’s crucial to seek to understand the people you will be working with and relying on throughout the phases of the project lifecycle. Sharing information with stakeholders is important, but it is equally important to first gather information about your stakeholders.

### Consult, early and often

A project, particularly in the early stages, may be unclear to its stakeholders for example, in terms of purpose, scope, risks and approach.  Early, then regular consultation is essential to ensure that requirements are agreed and a delivery solution is negotiated that is acceptable to the majority of stakeholders.

### Remember, they’re only human

Accept that humans do not always behave in a rational, reasonable, consistent or predictable way and operate with an awareness of human feelings and potential personal agendas. By understanding the root cause of stakeholder behaviour, you can assess if there is a better way to work together to maintain a productive relationship. Show empathy and emotional intelligence while given challenges.

### Plan it! 

A more conscientious and measured approach to stakeholder engagement is essential and therefore encouraged. Investment in careful planning before engaging stakeholders can bring significant benefits.

### Relationships are key

Developing relationships results in increased trust. And where there is trust, people work together more easily and effectively. Investing effort in identifying and building stakeholder relationships can increase confidence across the project environment, minimise uncertainty, and speed problem solving and decision-making.

### Simple, but not easy

Over and above conventional planning, using foresight to anticipate hazards, and taking simple and timely actions with stakeholders can significantly improve project delivery. Although this principle is self-evident, in practice is still only rarely done very well.

### Just part of managing risk

Stakeholders are important influential resources and should be treated as potential sources of risk and opportunity within the project.

### Compromise

The initial step is to establish the most acceptable baseline across a set of stakeholders' diverging expectations and priorities. Assess the relative importance of all stakeholders to establish a weighted hierarchy against the project requirements and agreed by the project Sponsor.

### Understand what success is 

Project success means different things to different people and you need to establish what your stakeholder community perceives success to be for them in the context of project delivery.

### Take responsibility

Stakeholder engagement is not the job of one member of the project team. It’s the responsibility of everyone to understand their role and to follow the right approach to communication and engagement. Good project governance requires providing clarity about stakeholder engagement roles and responsibilities and what is expected of people involved in the project.

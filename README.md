## Digital Transformation 

Mission: Drive digital capability and optimise operational efficiency


Digital Transformation is the change associated with the application of digital technology. However, digital transformation is more than technology. It is a mindset shift. It is the adoption of new ways of working and ultimately it is the marrying of people and process to gain a competitive advantage.

When planning for digital transformation, organizations must factor the cultural changes they'll confront as workers and organizational leaders adjust to adopting and relying on unfamiliar technologies.

Practices used in transformation include methodologies like Agile (SCRUM, KANBAN) , XP, Waterfall, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, Micro-services, Containerization, Severless Computing, IaaS, PaaS, ITaaS, Headerless CMS, Hybrid CMS, Big Data, Analytics, Machine Learning, Change Management, Cloud Computing, Digital Security, Leadership & Development,IoT,Chat Bots, Video Chats, and Mobility Management.

### Structure

DT can be built around the following. The exact structure will vary depending on the specific needs of the business:

1. Understand the Corporate Strategy and business domain

2. Assess current state of IT Strategy and understanding  existing systems and processes

3. Define Initiatives 

4. Develop a Strategy Roadmap

	i. Objective setting and measures of success (What you want to achieve - 
		digitally and as a wider business)

	ii. Opportunity Analysis - What you could be doing and potential rewards

	iii. Barrier analysis - What’s stopping you doing this? How we can get around this

	iv. Customer profiling and needs analysis - How you could serve your audiences better

     v. Stakeholder engagement and Market Analysis.

5. Communicate  strategy Execution

 ## Agile  

Agile management involves the division of a company into small teams of employees, each one acting like a start-up in its own right. The aim is to change the way in which your company runs to meet the ever-changing demands of the global market. The ‘Agile Manifesto,’ highlights key messages behind the system – including self-organisation, autonomous, collaboration and cross-functionality of teams.

Lean Agile Leadership is established through empowerment:  Building, autonomous, self-organising, cross functional and collaboration.

### Squads

The individual teams that make up a company in agile management are known as squads. The idea is that each squad has its own defined goal, which they work towards autonomously. Each squad has a ‘product owner’: they prioritise work to be done. However, they don’t tell employees how to work. Squad members also have access to an ‘agile coach’ to keep them up to date and well informed. Example: The 'Shopping  UI Basket', 'Tapestry' 'Platform Gateway', 'LOOM' and 'Platform Core' teams.

### Tribes

A tribe is the name given to a collection of squads working together in a business. They can be seen as an incubator for the mini start-up squads in your company. Tribes will usually not exceed more than around 100 employees. Example: Shopping 'Backend' and 'Test' Teams.

In large organisations where a department could possibly have say a 1000 employees, the optimum thing to do is to break the team down into smaller numbers and make them cross functional and self organising making them manageable.

### Guilds

The idea behind guilds is that they glue the company together and ensure you avoid losing economies of scale without sacrificing too much autonomy. In other words, guilds allow for cross-referencing between squads. Example: 'Shopping'.


### Benefits of AGILE

#### 1. Revenue

The iterative nature of agile development means features are delivered incrementally, enabling some benefits to be realised early as the product continues to develop.


#### 2. Speed-to-market

Research suggests about 80% of all market leaders were first to market. As well as the higher revenue from incremental delivery, the agile development philosophy also supports the notion of early and regular releases, and ‘perpetual beta’.


#### 3. Quality

A key principle of agile development is that testing is integrated throughout the cycle (TDD, BDD, Automation etc), enabling regular inspection of the working product as it develops. This allows the product owner to make adjustments if necessary and gives the product team early sight of any quality issues.


#### 4. Visibility

Agile development principles encourage active user involvement throughout the product’s development and a very cooperative collaborative approach. This provides excellent visibility  for key stakeholders, both of the project’s progress and of the product itself, which in turn helps to ensure that expectations are effectively managed.


#### 5. Risk Management

Small incremental releases made visible to the product owner and product team through its development help to identify any issues early and make it easier to respond to change. The clear visibility in agile development helps to ensure that any necessary decisions can be taken at the earliest possible opportunity, while there’s still time to make a material difference to the outcome.


#### 6. Flexibility / Agility

In traditional development projects, we write a big spec up-front and then tell business owners how expensive it is to change anything, particularly as the project goes on. In fear of scope creep and a never-ending project, we resist changes and put people through a change control committee to keep them to the essential minimum. Agile development principles are different. In agile development, change is accepted. In fact, it’s expected. Because the one thing that’s certain in life is change. Instead the timescale is fixed and requirements emerge and evolve as the product is developed. Of course for this to work, it’s imperative to have an actively involved  stakeholder who understands this concept and makes the necessary trade-off decisions, trading existing scope for new.


#### 7. Cost Control

The above approach of fixed timescales and evolving requirements enables a fixed budget. The scope of the product and its features are variable, rather than the cost.


#### 8. Business Engagement/Customer Satisfaction
 
The active involvement of a user representative and/or product owner, the high visibility  of the product and progress, and the flexibility to change when change is needed, create much better business engagement and customer satisfaction. This is an important benefit that can create much more positive and enduring working relationships.


#### 9. Right Product

Above all other points, the ability for agile development requirements to emerge and evolve, and the ability to embrace change (with the appropriate trade-offs), the team build the right product. It’s all too common in more traditional projects to deliver a “successful” project in IT terms and find that the product is not what was expected, needed or hoped for. In agile development, the emphasis is absolutely on building the right product.


#### 10. More Enjoyable!

The active involvement, cooperation and collaboration make agile development teams a much more enjoyable place for most people. Instead of big specs, we discuss requirements in workshops. Instead of lengthy status reports, we collaborate around a task-board discussing progress. Instead of long project plans and change management committees, we discuss what’s right for the product and project and the team is empowered to make decisions. In my experience this makes it a much more rewarding approach for everyone. In turn this helps to create highly motivated, high performance teams that are highly co-operative.



### Implementing SAFe Lean Agile Development

SAFe emphasizes the values of autonomous, self-organisng, cross-functional teams and Agile Release Trains.
This supports a leaner management infrastructure, with more empowered individuals and teams and faster, 
local decision making. Taditional, day-to-day employee instructions and activity  direction is no longer required.

However, all employees  still need someone to assist them with career development, set and manage expectations
and provide the active coaching they need to advance their technical, functional, individual and team 
skills and career goals.  They also have a right to serve as an integral member of a high performing team.

Self organising ARTs do not fund themselves or define their own mission. That remains a management responsibility,
as it is an element of implementation of a  strategy.

Much of this responsibility falls to the traditional role of the Development or Engineering Manager.


## The Development or Engineering Manager
The Development or Engineering Manager exhibits the principles and practices of Lean-Agile servant leadership. 
Coaching Scrum teams to deliver effectively, at a sustainable pace, and as Advisor
to use agile engineering practices such as automated builds and TDD. 

Further, the Manager  takes responsibility for eliminating impediments, actively evolves the systems
in which all knowledge workers operate, takes subtle control in assigning individuals to teams, 
participates in defining and administering compensation, benefilts and promotions, 
evaluate performance, including team input and corrective actions, remains close 
enough to the team to add value and to be competent, input into training and development strategy,
organising training and themed dev community months/internal developer conferences.

Other duties will include involved in recruitment and retention strategy, on-boarding new developers, 
co-facilitating development community of practice, appraisals & Performance Management, 
organising recognition awards and socials, and finally stays far away to let them problem-solve on their own.

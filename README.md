## Digital Transformation 

Mission: Drive digital capability and optimise operational efficiency


Digital Transformation is the change associated with the application of digital technology. However, digital transformation is more than technology. It is a mindset shift. It is the adoption of new ways of working and ultimately it is the marrying of people and process to gain a competitive advantage.

When planning for digital transformation, organizations must factor the cultural changes they'll confront as workers and organizational leaders adjust to adopting and relying on unfamiliar technologies.

Practices used in transformation include methodologies like Agile (SCRUM, KANBAN) , XP, Waterfall, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, Micro-services, Containerization, Severless Computing, IaaS, PaaS, ITaaS, Headerless CMS, Hybrid CMS, Big Data, Analytics, Machine Learning, Change Management, Cloud Computing, Digital Security, Leadership & Development,IoT,Chat Bots, Video Chats, and Mobility Management.

### Structure

DT can be built around the following. The exact structure will vary depending on the specific needs of the business:

1. Understand the Corporate Strategy and business domain

2. Assess current state of IT Strategy and understanding  existing systems and processes

3. Define Initiatives 

4. Develop a Strategy Roadmap

	i. Objective setting and measures of success (What you want to achieve - 
		digitally and as a wider business)

	ii. Opportunity Analysis - What you could be doing and potential rewards

	iii. Barrier analysis - What’s stopping you doing this? How we can get around this

	iv. Customer profiling and needs analysis - How you could serve your audiences better

     v. Stakeholder engagement and Market Analysis.

5. Communicate  strategy Execution

### The CADMA Effect

C - Create a Vision

A - Analyse the market

D - Design the experience

M - Measure the impact

A - Adjust the infrastructure.

 ## Agile  

Agile management involves the division of a company into small teams of employees, each one acting like a start-up in its own right. The aim is to change the way in which your company runs to meet the ever-changing demands of the global market. The ‘Agile Manifesto,’ highlights key messages behind the system – including self-organisation, autonomous, collaboration and cross-functionality of teams.

Lean Agile Leadership is established through empowerment:  Building, autonomous, self-organising, cross functional and collaboration.

### Squads

The individual teams that make up a company in agile management are known as squads. The idea is that each squad has its own defined goal, which they work towards autonomously. Each squad has a ‘product owner’: they prioritise work to be done. However, they don’t tell employees how to work. Squad members also have access to an ‘agile coach’ to keep them up to date and well informed. Example: The 'Shopping  UI Basket', 'Tapestry' 'Platform Gateway', 'LOOM' and 'Platform Core' teams.

### Tribes

A tribe is the name given to a collection of squads working together in a business. They can be seen as an incubator for the mini start-up squads in your company. Tribes will usually not exceed more than around 100 employees. Example: Shopping 'Backend' and 'Test' Teams.

In large organisations where a department could possibly have say a 1000 employees, the optimum thing to do is to break the team down into smaller numbers and make them cross functional and self organising making them manageable.

### Guilds

The idea behind guilds is that they glue the company together and ensure you avoid losing economies of scale without sacrificing too much autonomy. In other words, guilds allow for cross-referencing between squads. Example: 'Shopping'.


### Benefits of AGILE

#### 1. Revenue

The iterative nature of agile development means features are delivered incrementally, enabling some benefits to be realised early as the product continues to develop.


#### 2. Speed-to-market

Research suggests about 80% of all market leaders were first to market. As well as the higher revenue from incremental delivery, the agile development philosophy also supports the notion of early and regular releases, and ‘perpetual beta’.


#### 3. Quality

A key principle of agile development is that testing is integrated throughout the cycle (TDD, BDD, Automation etc), enabling regular inspection of the working product as it develops. This allows the product owner to make adjustments if necessary and gives the product team early sight of any quality issues.


#### 4. Visibility

Agile development principles encourage active user involvement throughout the product’s development and a very cooperative collaborative approach. This provides excellent visibility  for key stakeholders, both of the project’s progress and of the product itself, which in turn helps to ensure that expectations are effectively managed.


#### 5. Risk Management

Small incremental releases made visible to the product owner and product team through its development help to identify any issues early and make it easier to respond to change. The clear visibility in agile development helps to ensure that any necessary decisions can be taken at the earliest possible opportunity, while there’s still time to make a material difference to the outcome.


#### 6. Flexibility / Agility

In traditional development projects, we write a big spec up-front and then tell business owners how expensive it is to change anything, particularly as the project goes on. In fear of scope creep and a never-ending project, we resist changes and put people through a change control committee to keep them to the essential minimum. Agile development principles are different. In agile development, change is accepted. In fact, it’s expected. Because the one thing that’s certain in life is change. Instead the timescale is fixed and requirements emerge and evolve as the product is developed. Of course for this to work, it’s imperative to have an actively involved  stakeholder who understands this concept and makes the necessary trade-off decisions, trading existing scope for new.


#### 7. Cost Control

The above approach of fixed timescales and evolving requirements enables a fixed budget. The scope of the product and its features are variable, rather than the cost.


#### 8. Business Engagement/Customer Satisfaction
 
The active involvement of a user representative and/or product owner, the high visibility  of the product and progress, and the flexibility to change when change is needed, create much better business engagement and customer satisfaction. This is an important benefit that can create much more positive and enduring working relationships.


#### 9. Right Product

Above all other points, the ability for agile development requirements to emerge and evolve, and the ability to embrace change (with the appropriate trade-offs), the team build the right product. It’s all too common in more traditional projects to deliver a “successful” project in IT terms and find that the product is not what was expected, needed or hoped for. In agile development, the emphasis is absolutely on building the right product.


#### 10. More Enjoyable!

The active involvement, cooperation and collaboration make agile development teams a much more enjoyable place for most people. Instead of big specs, we discuss requirements in workshops. Instead of lengthy status reports, we collaborate around a task-board discussing progress. Instead of long project plans and change management committees, we discuss what’s right for the product and project and the team is empowered to make decisions. In my experience this makes it a much more rewarding approach for everyone. In turn this helps to create highly motivated, high performance teams that are highly co-operative.



### Implementing SAFe Lean Agile Development

SAFe emphasizes the values of autonomous, self-organisng, cross-functional teams and Agile Release Trains.
This supports a leaner management infrastructure, with more empowered individuals and teams and faster, 
local decision making. Taditional, day-to-day employee instructions and activity  direction is no longer required.

However, all employees  still need someone to assist them with career development, set and manage expectations
and provide the active coaching they need to advance their technical, functional, individual and team 
skills and career goals.  They also have a right to serve as an integral member of a high performing team.

Self organising ARTs do not fund themselves or define their own mission. That remains a management responsibility,
as it is an element of implementation of a  strategy.

Much of this responsibility falls to the traditional role of the Development or Engineering Manager.


## The Development or Engineering Manager
The Development or Engineering Manager exhibits the principles and practices of Lean-Agile servant leadership. 
Coaching Scrum teams to deliver effectively, at a sustainable pace, and as Advisor
to use agile engineering practices such as automated builds and TDD. 

Further, the Manager  takes responsibility for eliminating impediments, actively evolves the systems
in which all knowledge workers operate, takes subtle control in assigning individuals to teams, 
participates in defining and administering compensation, benefilts and promotions, 
evaluate performance, including team input and corrective actions, remains close 
enough to the team to add value and to be competent, input into training and development strategy,
organising training and themed dev community months/internal developer conferences.

Other duties will include involved in recruitment and retention strategy, on-boarding new developers, 
co-facilitating development community of practice, appraisals & Performance Management, 
organising recognition awards and socials, and finally stays far away to let them problem-solve on their own.


## DORA

_DevOps Research Assessment_

The primary goal of DORA is to help organizations understand and improve their DevOps capabilities through evidence-based research and data-driven insights

DORA provides valuable benchmarks and best practices for seeking and optimising DevOps initiatives.

### Key Metrics:

Lead Time: The time it takes to convert a customer request or idea into a production-ready feature or service.

Deployment Frequency: The frequency at which an organization deploys changes or releases to production.

Change Failure Rate: The percentage of changes or releases that result in failure or negatively impact the system's stability.

Time to Restore Service: The time it takes to recover from a service disruption or failure and restore normal operations.


## How long should a sprint planning meeting last?
In your experience, how long should a Sprint Planning meeting (Scrum) last? 8 hours? Or should it be shorter (succinct) and further discussions should be planned as part of the sprint? Our Sprints are 10 days long.


8 hours per a 10 day sprint definitely sounds too much to me. Discussions which don't require the whole team should be taken out into separate sessions, only for the members involved

So you plan other meetings instead of discussing everything in the planning?

Discussions should happen about upcoming ideas and plans so that most team members have some basic and shared understanding about them. The criterion is this: during the planning meeting, nobody should be surprised because of hearing a certain thing for the first time. Whenever such "surprise" happens, adjust by increasing the amount of communication that happens before the next planning meeting. (Exceptions to this are truly groundbreaking announcements coming from project owners.) 

According to the Scrum Guide:

The Sprint Planning Meeting is time-boxed to eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is proportionately shorter. For example, two-week Sprints have four-hour Sprint Planning Meetings.


Probably a good starting point, but it should also be noted that you do need to tailor the process to your project, team, and organization so that it works for you. Just because other people have had luck with it doesn't mean it will work for you right out of the box. – Thomas Owens♦ Sep 13 '11 at 20:21


However, if you're going to try Scrum, you should probably try it based on the defined guidelines first. Then, if something isn't working, refine it. If you change the rules before you even start, you're disregarding the empirical evidence that made the folks who devised Scrum recommend what they recommended--without any empirical evidence to show that that's the wrong thing for you.


In my team of 3, we usually only had half-hour long sprints, and when the team was 7, it was usually only an hour for two week long sprints


As long as it needs to last, no less and no more. Anything else isn't Agile.

If you have a team of 2 - 3 developers and are doing 1 week sprints anything more than a hour is probably counter productive.

If you have a team of 15 people and 2 weeks sprints you are looking at all day, anything less isn't detailed enough.

It takes experience to get it mostly right, and that is what retrospectives are for, the team decides what is too long or too short.

Don't worry about getting it perfect or sticking to what some book says, try something and refine it


SCRUM is about refining the process in iterations as much as it is about refining your code in iterations.

An hour seems a bit short for 3 developers / 1 week sprints. Then again, I just finished a relatively small project where we did a 5-minute weekly sprint planning. It depends on the project, and on the cards, because sometimes more (or less) discussion is needed during sprint planning.

One of the key ideas of Scrum, as an Agile framework, is that you time-box activities, such as the sprint, the sprint planning meeting, and the daily stand-up/scrum. The point is to keep things focused. Time-boxing does not mean that you cannot take less time than is designated. Just that you should not take more, as that tends to make people lose focus and also reduces the amount of time the team has to actually do the work.


Do not mold your business around the process. The process supports your business. The moment you're doing process for its own sake it's time for the process to get the axe. To that end, there is no "right" way. Meetings should only go as long as you are accomplishing something in them. If it takes you 30 minutes or 4 hours, as long as it works then go with it. Ignore what some book/blog/coach tells you and do what is right for you.


Why not start the process as designed and adapt from there? If you decide to use agile practices and haven't molded your business in that direction, you're already in trouble.

Take as long as you need so that you select enough that your team thinks they can reasonably achieve in the sprint. But you should be spending time during the (previous) sprint refining the backlog: estimating and refining stories.

### Product Backlog Refinement
One of the lesser known, but valuable, guidelines in Scrum is that five or ten percent of each Sprint must be dedicated by the Team to refining (or “grooming”) the Product Backlog. This includes detailed requirements analysis, splitting large items into smaller ones, estimation of new items, and re-estimation of existing items.

Scrum is silent on how this work is done, but a frequently used technique is a focused workshop near the end of the Sprint, so that the Team and Product Owner can dedicate themselves to this work without interruption. For a two-week Sprint, five percent of the duration implies that each Sprint there is a half-day Product Backlog Refinement workshop.

This refinement activity is not for items selected for the current Sprint; it is for items for the future, most likely in the next one or two Sprints. With this practice, Sprint Planning becomes relatively simple because the Product Owner and Scrum Team start the planning with a clear, well-analyzed and carefully estimated set of items. A sign that this refinement workshop is not being done (or not being done well) is that Sprint Planning involves significant questions, discovery, or confusion and feels incomplete; planning work then often spills over into the Sprint itself, which is typically not desirable.


Doing this means you can focus on planning during planning, and it doesn't take all day and the team starts to lose focus and get bored.

### Duration
In Scrum, when working to 2 week sprints, the sprint planning is time-boxed at 4 hours, making it a half day event. One reason for the relatively large amount of time is that the development team must be able to confidently agree that all items being pulled into the sprint backlog can be delivered, which means they need to know the detail. It is not uncommon as part of sprint planning for teams to break off from the meeting space for periods of time in order to investigate items further and ensure that they are "Ready" to go into the sprint backlog. (It can help to think of sprint planning as an event, rather than a meeting.)

Use your "Definition of Ready" and the length of time that the sprint planning event allows to ensure that all backlog items going into the sprint are both feasible and ready. i.e. They can be done (completely, as per "Definition of Done") within the sprint, and there is enough information for the team to be able to do them right now. Note of course that you probably don't want to be doing this for ALL items during the sprint planning, as it can be very time consuming. Do try and have regular backlog grooming (outwith sprint planning) where you can breakdown backlog items, and estimate items not yet estimated using planning poker for example. (I've found this can be a effective activity for over a working dinner with the development team, should you have the luxury of your team's availability at dinner time!)

High priority items can often be added to the product backlog by the product owner just prior to sprint planning though, and whilst routine backlog grooming can, and normally should, be done before the sprint planning event, there will always be new items like this where the team needs to spend time working out the detail and estimating complexity during the sprint planning event, hence why it can stretch to 4 hours for 10 day/2 week sprints.

If you need to take longer discussions out of this event, then you might have a backlog item in the sprint backlog to "have such and such a discussion to establish x", but you should avoid including sprint items to do whatever you are going to determine needs done during that discussion, as those are not "ready" backlog items to go into the sprint.

As people have said, there are reasons you might want to change the way you run Scrum if the process isn't working effectively for you. Scrum is however, a very well thought out and tested framework to start with so I would make sure your reasoning is justified before changing the process.

The SPRINT agenda
In the Sprint Planning Meeting, the team has to determine two sets of things:


A) What will be developed by the team during this Sprint

B) How it will be developed

This meeting must be time-boxed, up to two hours for each week of the Sprint, split evenly for each part (part A and Part B) of the meeting.

So, for a Sprint of 4 weeks, this meeting should be no longer than 8 hours, up to 4 hours for part A and up to 4 hours for part B.

During part A, the dev team has to estimate the team velocity that they consider they will have during this Sprint. They also have to estimate the top priority user stories, and choose enough of these (already estimated) user stories to complete in line with their own estimated team velocity.

In part B, the dev team will discuss how to develop the more challenging user stories already selected to be developed. Most probably, the dev team will not have enough time to discuss how to develop all the selected user stories, so, the team has to choose the most challenging user stories.

During the Sprint, the dev team has enough time to complete this discussion.
